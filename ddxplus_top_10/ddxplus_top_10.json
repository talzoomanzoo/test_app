Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nSpecificity (1-5): How much the INITIAL FEEDBACK pinpoints exact errors, such as incorrect interpretations of medical data, misapplication of diagnostic or therapeutic protocols, vague or ambiguous statements in the response.\nA specific INITIAL FEEDBACK should suggest concrete improvements and avoid generic comments like \"improve accuracy\" without specifying how or where.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 indicates that the INITIAL FEEDBACK lacks specificity and contains significant deficiencies in addressing errors or areas for improvement. It may fail to pinpoint exact issues in the INPUT, such as inaccurate interpretations of medical data, misapplication of clinical guidelines, or vague, overly general suggestions. This level of feedback might overlook critical aspects of the INPUT, offer irrelevant comments, or provide insufficient detail to guide meaningful revisions.\nA score of 5 reflects that the INITIAL FEEDBACK is highly specific, accurate, and actionable. It clearly identifies precise errors or areas for improvement, such as misinterpretations of medical data, deviations from established protocols, or unclear statements. The feedback should be well-organized, aligned with current medical guidelines, and directly address the INPUT. Unnecessary or tangential remarks (if any) should be clearly marked as not useful, ensuring the feedback remains focused on refining the medical response effectively.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL FEEDBACK carefully.\n2. Rate INITIAL FEEDBACK on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4.

Cluster headaches are known for their intense, sharp, or burning pain, often described as \"knife-like\" or \"piercing.\"\n\n2. **Location of pain**: The patient reports the pain is located on the forehead and cheek, which is a common location for cluster headaches. Cluster headaches typically occur on one side of the head, often around the eye or temple.\n\n3. **Intensity and duration**: The patient reports the pain intensity as 7 out of 10, which is consistent with cluster headaches. Cluster headaches are known for their high intensity and short duration, typically lasting between 15 minutes to 3 hours.\n\n4. **Frequency and pattern**: Although the patient's pain history is not detailed, cluster headaches often occur in clusters or cycles, with multiple headaches occurring in a short period.\n\n5. **Family history**: The patient reports no family history of cluster headaches, which is not uncommon, as cluster headaches are not typically inherited.\n\n6. **Other symptoms**: The patient does not report excessive tearing, nasal congestion, or other symptoms commonly associated with cluster headaches.\n\nConsidering the above points, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is:\n\n```Cluster headache```\n\nINITIAL FEEDBACK:\nYour reasoning regarding the diagnosis of \"Cluster headache\" is well-structured and takes into account several important factors. However, there are a few points to consider that may warrant further examination:\n\n1. **Pain Characteristics**: While the descriptors \"violent,\" \"sharp,\" and \"knife stroke\" align with cluster headaches, the term \"haunting\" and \"tugging\" are less typical for this condition. These additional descriptors could suggest other types of headaches or pain syndromes that may not fit the classic presentation of cluster headaches.\n\n2. **Location of Pain**: The pain is reported in both cheeks and both eyes, which raises a question about the unilateral nature typically associated with cluster headaches. Cluster headaches usually present on one side of the head, often around the eye or temple.\n\n3. **Intensity and Duration**: The intensity of 7 out of 10 is consistent with cluster headaches, but without information on the duration or frequency of the episodes, it is difficult to fully assess the likelihood of this diagnosis.\n\n4. **Other Symptoms**: The absence of symptoms such as excessive tearing or nasal congestion does not rule out cluster headaches, but it is worth noting that these symptoms are often present. The lack of these symptoms may suggest that other headache types should also be considered.\n\n5. **Differential Diagnosis**: While cluster headaches are a strong consideration, other types of headaches (such as tension-type headaches or migraines) could also present with similar pain characteristics. It may be beneficial to explore these possibilities further.\n\n6. **Family History**: The absence of a family history of cluster headaches does not negate the diagnosis, but it is worth noting that some individuals may still experience them without a familial link.\n\nOverall, while \"Cluster headache\" is a reasonable diagnosis based on the information provided, the bilateral nature of the pain and the additional descriptors may suggest that further evaluation is needed to rule out other headache types or conditions. \n\n```STOP```\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

It highlights potential inconsistencies in pain characteristics and the bilateral nature of the pain that are atypical for cluster headaches, demonstrating a good understanding of the medical context. The feedback also acknowledges the absence of certain symptoms typically associated with cluster headaches while maintaining that their absence doesn't entirely rule out the diagnosis. Suggestions for considering differential diagnoses are also consistent with the need for careful evaluation. However, while the feedback emphasizes the need for additional investigation, it could provide more specific guidance on evaluating and discussing the alternative diagnoses, which might enhance its consistency and completeness.

It appropriately points out several factors that are commonly associated with cluster headaches, such as the intensity and nature of the pain, and also acknowledges areas that require caution or further examination:\n\n1. **Pain Characteristics**: Correctly identifies that while \"violent,\" \"sharp,\" and \"knife stroke\" align with cluster headache descriptors, terms like \"haunting\" and \"tugging\" are atypical. This demonstrates a nuanced understanding of symptom analysis.\n\n2. **Location of Pain**: Correctly notes that cluster headaches are typically unilateral, and bilateral pain locations reported by the patient raise questions about the diagnosis. This is an important consideration, and it's well-articulated.\n\n3. **Intensity and Duration**: Acknowledges that the intensity is consistent with cluster headaches but correctly points out the lack of information on duration and frequency, which is critical for an accurate diagnosis.\n\n4. **Other Symptoms**: While the feedback correctly notes the absence of other commonly associated symptoms (tearing, nasal congestion), it also states that their absence does not rule out cluster headaches, which aligns with medical understanding.\n\n5. **Differential Diagnosis**: Constructively suggests considering other conditions like tension-type headaches or migraines, which is a critical step in differential diagnosis.\n\n6. **Family History**: Properly assesses the non-significance of the absence of a family history, aligning with medical guidelines.\n\nThe only minor issue could be the lack of emphasis on the need for a complete clinical examination and potentially further tests to rule out other conditions definitively, which would increase the comprehensiveness of the feedback.

It evaluates the INITIAL RESPONSE carefully, acknowledging accurate points while also addressing areas that need further consideration. The feedback provides actionable suggestions by questioning the bilateral pain location, atypical pain descriptors, and lack of additional symptoms, indicating where the differential diagnosis could be expanded. It remains informative, encouraging deeper investigation into other potential headache types. Additionally, the feedback maintains a balanced and non-dismissive tone, which encourages improvement without undermining the initial reasoning. Overall, it adheres closely to guidelines for providing constructive, precise, and comprehensive feedback, making it a 5 on the scale."
