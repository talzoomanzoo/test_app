Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nSpecificity (1-5): How much the INITIAL FEEDBACK pinpoints exact errors, such as incorrect interpretations of medical data, misapplication of diagnostic or therapeutic protocols, vague or ambiguous statements in the response.\nA specific INITIAL FEEDBACK should suggest concrete improvements and avoid generic comments like \"improve accuracy\" without specifying how or where.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 indicates that the INITIAL FEEDBACK lacks specificity and contains significant deficiencies in addressing errors or areas for improvement. It may fail to pinpoint exact issues in the INPUT, such as inaccurate interpretations of medical data, misapplication of clinical guidelines, or vague, overly general suggestions. This level of feedback might overlook critical aspects of the INPUT, offer irrelevant comments, or provide insufficient detail to guide meaningful revisions.\nA score of 5 reflects that the INITIAL FEEDBACK is highly specific, accurate, and actionable. It clearly identifies precise errors or areas for improvement, such as misinterpretations of medical data, deviations from established protocols, or unclear statements. The feedback should be well-organized, aligned with current medical guidelines, and directly address the INPUT. Unnecessary or tangential remarks (if any) should be clearly marked as not useful, ensuring the feedback remains focused on refining the medical response effectively.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL FEEDBACK carefully.\n2. Rate INITIAL FEEDBACK on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Specificity Score after the word PREDICTION:\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 24\\nSex: F\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux?\\n    - N\\nHave you noticed a high pitched sound when breathing in?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre you exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Larygospasm'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step to determine the most likely diagnosis for this patient.\n\n1. **Age and sex**: The patient is a 24-year-old female. This information is useful but doesn't directly point to a specific diagnosis.\n\n2. **Asthma and bronchodilator use**: The patient has never had asthma or used a bronchodilator. This makes asthma less likely.\n\n3. **Gastroesophageal reflux**: The patient has never been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux. While this condition can cause symptoms similar to those of laryngospasm, the absence of gastroesophageal reflux makes it less likely.\n\n4. **High-pitched sound when breathing in**: The patient has not noticed a high-pitched sound when breathing in, which is often associated with stridor, a symptom of laryngospasm.\n\n5. **Travel history**: The patient has not traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks, which reduces the likelihood of infectious causes such as foreign travel-related illnesses.\n\n6. **Exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke**: The patient is not exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a daily basis, which reduces the likelihood of respiratory conditions related to smoking.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely option is not directly supported by the information provided. However, given the options provided, I would choose:\n\n```Larygospasm```\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that laryngospasm is typically associated with a high-pitched sound when breathing in (stridor), which the patient has not reported. A more likely diagnosis would be a condition that doesn't have a clear indication from the provided information.\n\nINITIAL FEEDBACK:\nYour reasoning is well-structured, but there are several critical points to consider regarding the diagnosis of laryngospasm:\n\n1. **Symptom Presentation**: Laryngospasm is characterized by a sudden closure of the vocal cords, which typically results in stridor (a high-pitched sound during inhalation) and difficulty breathing. The patient's denial of a high-pitched sound when breathing in is a significant factor that contradicts the diagnosis of laryngospasm.\n\n2. **Absence of Symptoms**: The patient does not report any symptoms that would typically accompany laryngospasm, such as difficulty breathing, choking sensations, or a history of episodes. This absence raises questions about the appropriateness of this diagnosis.\n\n3. **Other Conditions**: While laryngospasm is the only option provided, it may be beneficial to consider other potential causes of respiratory symptoms or discomfort that are not listed. The lack of asthma history and gastroesophageal reflux also suggests that other respiratory or gastrointestinal conditions could be at play.\n\n4. **Contextual Factors**: The patient's age and lack of exposure to secondhand smoke or recent travel history are helpful, but they do not provide enough context to support a diagnosis of laryngospasm without the presence of key symptoms.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the absence of critical symptoms associated with laryngospasm, it may be more appropriate to conclude that the diagnosis is not adequately supported by the information provided. If laryngospasm is the only option, it may be worth reconsidering the context or seeking additional information to clarify the patient's condition.\n\nIn summary, while you have chosen laryngospasm based on the options available, the lack of supporting symptoms significantly undermines this diagnosis. Further evaluation or alternative options may be necessary for a more accurate assessment.\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

This symptom is typically present in cases of laryngospasm, and its absence strongly suggests that this condition is unlikely.\n\n2. **Lack of Supporting Symptoms**: The patient does not exhibit other common symptoms associated with laryngospasm, such as difficulty breathing or a sensation of choking, which further weakens the case for this diagnosis.\n\n3. **Single Option Limitation**: The fact that laryngospasm is the only option provided limits the ability to make a definitive diagnosis. It is important to recognize that the absence of supporting symptoms means that even if laryngospasm is the only option, it does not mean it is the correct diagnosis.\n\n4. **Consideration of Other Conditions**: While laryngospasm is the only option, it would be prudent to consider other potential causes of respiratory symptoms that may not be listed, especially given the patient's young age and lack of significant medical history.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: While you have chosen to select laryngospasm as the diagnosis, it is essential to emphasize that the lack of key symptoms makes this diagnosis highly questionable. It may be more appropriate to indicate that the diagnosis does not align with the patient's presentation rather than affirming it as the selected option.\n\nIn summary, while you have followed a logical reasoning process, the conclusion that laryngospasm is the diagnosis should be reconsidered given the absence of critical symptoms. \n\n```STOP```",
