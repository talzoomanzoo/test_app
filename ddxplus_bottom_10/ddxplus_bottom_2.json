Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nSpecificity (1-5): How much the INITIAL FEEDBACK pinpoints exact errors, such as incorrect interpretations of medical data, misapplication of diagnostic or therapeutic protocols, vague or ambiguous statements in the response.\nA specific INITIAL FEEDBACK should suggest concrete improvements and avoid generic comments like \"improve accuracy\" without specifying how or where.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 indicates that the INITIAL FEEDBACK lacks specificity and contains significant deficiencies in addressing errors or areas for improvement. It may fail to pinpoint exact issues in the INPUT, such as inaccurate interpretations of medical data, misapplication of clinical guidelines, or vague, overly general suggestions. This level of feedback might overlook critical aspects of the INPUT, offer irrelevant comments, or provide insufficient detail to guide meaningful revisions.\nA score of 5 reflects that the INITIAL FEEDBACK is highly specific, accurate, and actionable. It clearly identifies precise errors or areas for improvement, such as misinterpretations of medical data, deviations from established protocols, or unclear statements. The feedback should be well-organized, aligned with current medical guidelines, and directly address the INPUT. Unnecessary or tangential remarks (if any) should be clearly marked as not useful, ensuring the feedback remains focused on refining the medical response effectively.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL FEEDBACK carefully.\n2. Rate INITIAL FEEDBACK on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Specificity Score after the word PREDICTION:\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 49\\nSex: M\\nHave you started or taken any antipsychotic medication within the last 7 days?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever felt like you were suffocating for a very short time associated with inability to breathe or speak?\\n    - N\\nHave you been treated in hospital recently for nausea, agitation, intoxication or aggressive behavior and received medication via an intravenous or intramuscular route?\\n    - N\\nDo you have trouble keeping your tongue in your mouth?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a hard time opening/raising one or both eyelids?\\n    - N\\nDo you have annoying muscle spasms in your face, neck or any other part of your body?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step to determine the most likely diagnosis for this patient.\n\n1. **Acute dystonic reactions** are a known side effect of antipsychotic medication, particularly when taken within the last 7 days. The patient has denied taking any antipsychotic medication within the last 7 days, which makes this option less likely.\n\n2. **Myasthenia gravis** is an autoimmune disease characterized by muscle weakness, which can be exacerbated by certain medications or conditions. The patient has denied experiencing muscle spasms, trouble keeping his tongue in his mouth, or difficulty opening/raising his eyelids, which are common symptoms of myasthenia gravis.\n\nHowever, the patient's symptoms are not entirely ruled out by the provided information. The patient's inability to breathe or speak for a very short time associated with feeling like he was suffocating could be indicative of a severe episode of myasthenic crisis, which is a life-threatening complication of myasthenia gravis.\n\nGiven the patient's age and sex, and the fact that he has not traveled out of the country recently, the likelihood of myasthenia gravis is still present, albeit low.\n\nHowever, considering the patient's symptoms and the options provided, I would choose the option that is more directly related to the patient's symptoms, even though it is not the most likely diagnosis.\n\n```Myasthenia gravis```\n\nINITIAL FEEDBACK:\nYour reasoning process is clear and methodical, but there are a few points that could be reconsidered:\n\n1. **Acute Dystonic Reactions**: You correctly noted that acute dystonic reactions are typically associated with recent use of antipsychotic medications. Since the patient has denied taking any antipsychotic medication within the last 7 days, this significantly reduces the likelihood of this diagnosis.\n\n2. **Myasthenia Gravis**: While you mentioned that the patient has not reported symptoms commonly associated with myasthenia gravis, such as muscle spasms or difficulty with eyelid movement, it is important to note that myasthenia gravis can present with fluctuating muscle weakness that may not always be apparent in a brief assessment. The absence of specific symptoms does not completely rule out the condition.\n\n3. **Consideration of Symptoms**: The mention of feeling like suffocating or having difficulty breathing or speaking could suggest a neuromuscular issue, but the patient explicitly denied these experiences. This makes it less likely that myasthenia gravis is the underlying issue, especially without any other supporting symptoms.\n\n4. **Other Potential Diagnoses**: It may be beneficial to consider other conditions that could cause muscle weakness or respiratory issues, as the options provided are limited. The absence of relevant symptoms for both conditions suggests that further evaluation might be necessary to explore other potential causes.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the information provided, the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis seems to be based on a hypothetical consideration rather than clear evidence from the patient's history and symptoms. Therefore, it may be more appropriate to conclude that neither diagnosis fits well based on the current information.\n\nOverall, while your choice of myasthenia gravis is understandable, the lack of supporting symptoms and the clear denial of relevant experiences suggest that a different approach or further investigation may be warranted. \n\n```STOP```\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

            "\n\n<b>Evaluation Criteria: CONSISTENCY</b>\n\n PREDICTION: 4\n\nThe INITIAL FEEDBACK is generally consistent throughout and provides a logical critique of the INITIAL RESPONSE. It aligns with medical reasoning regarding the conditions discussed and conveys a uniform tone. Each point builds on the previous ones without contradictions. \n\n1. The feedback correctly supports the reduced likelihood of acute dystonic reactions due to the denial of recent antipsychotic usage.\n2. Regarding myasthenia gravis, the feedback acknowledges the fluctuation in muscle weakness, though it seems to slightly contradict the INITIAL RESPONSE's uncertainty about ruling out the symptoms. However, this is nuanced rather than completely inconsistent.\n3. The feedback does note that the patient's denial of suffocation-like experiences lessens the likelihood of myasthenia gravis and rightly suggests considering other potential diagnoses.\n4. It advises re-evaluating the conclusion drawn by the INITIAL RESPONSE, which is based on hypothetical rather than clear evidence, and suggests further investigation might be needed.\n\nThe feedback could potentially put more emphasis on the patient's explicit symptom denials which were not fully addressed, but overall it provides a coherent, actionable critique without significant conflicts or inconsistencies.",
            "\n\n<b>Evaluation Criteria: RELEVANCE</b>\n\n PREDICTION: 4\n\nThe INITIAL FEEDBACK is generally relevant and addresses the critical aspects of the INITIAL RESPONSE. It acknowledges the reasoning behind ruling out acute dystonic reactions due to the absence of recent antipsychotic medication, aligning with established medical understanding. The feedback correctly points out the lack of symptoms in myasthenia gravis and highlights the need for considering fluctuating symptoms, a common characteristic of myasthenia gravis.\n\nThe FEEDBACK also emphasizes that the suffocation-like symptoms were denied by the patient, which is important for evaluating the likelihood of myasthenia gravis. However, it introduces some level of hypotheticals and suggests considering other diagnoses or further evaluation, which is somewhat tangential given the options provided. Nonetheless, the overall guidance adds value by suggesting a need for further investigation in the absence of clear supporting symptoms, maintaining relevance to medical clarity and clinical reasoning.",
            "\n\n<b>Evaluation Criteria: CORRECTNESS</b>\n\n PREDICTION: 4\n\nThe INITIAL FEEDBACK provided is largely accurate and adheres to medical principles concerning the diagnoses of acute dystonic reactions and myasthenia gravis. It correctly points out that acute dystonic reactions are typically tied to recent antipsychotic use, which the patient denies, thus reducing its likelihood. The feedback also accurately discusses that myasthenia gravis can present with fluctuating symptoms and that the absence of certain symptoms doesn't entirely rule out the condition. However, the feedback overlooks that the initial response misinterprets the symptoms related to myasthenia gravis, as the patient explicitly denied feeling suffocated or having trouble breathing or speaking. It rightly suggests considering other possible causes, given the lack of supporting symptoms for both conditions presented. This feedback would benefit from more directly highlighting any inaccuracies in the initial reasoning about the suffocation and breathing issue. Nevertheless, the feedback provides a reasonable critique and encourages exploring other diagnoses, aligning with established medical guidelines.",
            "\n\n<b>Evaluation Criteria: CONSTRUCTIVENESS</b>\n\n PREDICTION: 5\n\nThe INITIAL FEEDBACK is highly constructive, offering clear and actionable suggestions to refine the INITIAL RESPONSE. It acknowledges the logical reasoning in the INITIAL RESPONSE but highlights key points for reconsideration:\n\n1. It accurately identifies the reasoning for ruling out acute dystonic reactions due to the absence of antipsychotic medication usage.\n2. It advises that myasthenia gravis could have fluctuating symptoms, suggesting that the condition cannot be completely ruled out due to transient symptomology.\n3. It corrects the misunderstanding of the patient's symptoms, pointing out they denied having breathing difficulties, thus making myasthenia gravis less likely.\n4. It suggests considering other potential diagnoses, guiding towards a more thorough investigation.\n5. It concludes by emphasizing the lack of clear evidence for myasthenia gravis and suggests exploring further investigations.\n\nThe feedback is precise, comprehensive, aligns well with medical reasoning, and effectively guides the model towards a more nuanced and accurate diagnosis process."
