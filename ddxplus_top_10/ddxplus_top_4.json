Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nSpecificity (1-5): How much the INITIAL FEEDBACK pinpoints exact errors, such as incorrect interpretations of medical data, misapplication of diagnostic or therapeutic protocols, vague or ambiguous statements in the response.\nA specific INITIAL FEEDBACK should suggest concrete improvements and avoid generic comments like \"improve accuracy\" without specifying how or where.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 indicates that the INITIAL FEEDBACK lacks specificity and contains significant deficiencies in addressing errors or areas for improvement. It may fail to pinpoint exact issues in the INPUT, such as inaccurate interpretations of medical data, misapplication of clinical guidelines, or vague, overly general suggestions. This level of feedback might overlook critical aspects of the INPUT, offer irrelevant comments, or provide insufficient detail to guide meaningful revisions.\nA score of 5 reflects that the INITIAL FEEDBACK is highly specific, accurate, and actionable. It clearly identifies precise errors or areas for improvement, such as misinterpretations of medical data, deviations from established protocols, or unclear statements. The feedback should be well-organized, aligned with current medical guidelines, and directly address the INPUT. Unnecessary or tangential remarks (if any) should be clearly marked as not useful, ensuring the feedback remains focused on refining the medical response effectively.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL FEEDBACK carefully.\n2. Rate INITIAL FEEDBACK on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Specificity Score after the word PREDICTION:\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 51\\nSex: M\\nHave you been in contact with a person with similar symptoms in the past 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you attend or work in a daycare?\\n    - N\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - sensitive\\n    - burning\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - tonsil(L)\\n    - thyroid cartilage\\n    - pharynx\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - nowhere\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 10 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 1 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have nasal congestion or a clear runny nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a cough?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Viral pharyngitis\\n- Bronchitis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- URTI\\n- Possible NSTEMI / STEMI\\n- Unstable angina\\n- Stable angina'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step to determine the most likely diagnosis for this patient.\n\n1. **Location of pain**: The patient reports pain in the pharynx, which is a common location for viral pharyngitis and URTI (Upper Respiratory Tract Infection).\n\n2. **Characteristics of pain**: The pain is described as sensitive and burning, which is consistent with viral pharyngitis.\n\n3. **Intensity and duration of pain**: The pain is reported to be intense (8/10) and has appeared quickly (1/10), which is consistent with an acute infection.\n\n4. **Absence of other symptoms**: The patient does not report pain in other locations, nasal congestion, cough, or recent travel, which makes conditions like bronchitis, acute laryngitis, and possible cardiac conditions less likely.\n\n5. **Age and sex**: The patient is a 51-year-old male, which is not particularly suggestive of any specific condition.\n\nConsidering these factors, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n```Viral pharyngitis```\n\nINITIAL FEEDBACK:\nYour reasoning regarding the diagnosis of \"Viral pharyngitis\" is well-structured, but there are a few points to consider that may warrant further examination:\n\n1. **Pain Characteristics**: While the sensitive and burning nature of the pain aligns with viral pharyngitis, it is also important to consider other potential causes of similar symptoms, such as bacterial infections (e.g., streptococcal pharyngitis) or even irritative conditions.\n\n2. **Intensity and Onset**: The pain intensity of 8/10 and rapid onset (1/10) could suggest a more severe condition. While viral pharyngitis can present this way, the intensity might also raise suspicion for a bacterial infection, especially if the pain is localized and severe.\n\n3. **Absence of Other Symptoms**: The lack of nasal congestion, cough, or other upper respiratory symptoms does make bronchitis and URTI less likely. However, the absence of fever or systemic symptoms could also suggest that the condition is not as acute as it might seem.\n\n4. **Cardiac Considerations**: Given the patient's age and sex, it is prudent to consider the possibility of cardiac issues, such as NSTEMI or unstable angina, especially since the pain is localized around the thyroid cartilage and pharynx. While the patient does not report typical cardiac symptoms, the presentation of pain in the neck area should not be overlooked.\n\n5. **Further Evaluation**: It may be beneficial to conduct a physical examination, including a throat examination, and possibly consider rapid testing for streptococcal infection or other causes of pharyngitis to rule out bacterial infections.\n\nOverall, while \"Viral pharyngitis\" is a reasonable diagnosis based on the information provided, the intensity of the pain and the potential for other serious conditions should prompt a careful evaluation to ensure that no other underlying issues are present. \n\n```STOP```\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",
