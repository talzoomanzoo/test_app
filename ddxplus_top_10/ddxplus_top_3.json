Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nSpecificity (1-5): How much the INITIAL FEEDBACK pinpoints exact errors, such as incorrect interpretations of medical data, misapplication of diagnostic or therapeutic protocols, vague or ambiguous statements in the response.\nA specific INITIAL FEEDBACK should suggest concrete improvements and avoid generic comments like \"improve accuracy\" without specifying how or where.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 indicates that the INITIAL FEEDBACK lacks specificity and contains significant deficiencies in addressing errors or areas for improvement. It may fail to pinpoint exact issues in the INPUT, such as inaccurate interpretations of medical data, misapplication of clinical guidelines, or vague, overly general suggestions. This level of feedback might overlook critical aspects of the INPUT, offer irrelevant comments, or provide insufficient detail to guide meaningful revisions.\nA score of 5 reflects that the INITIAL FEEDBACK is highly specific, accurate, and actionable. It clearly identifies precise errors or areas for improvement, such as misinterpretations of medical data, deviations from established protocols, or unclear statements. The feedback should be well-organized, aligned with current medical guidelines, and directly address the INPUT. Unnecessary or tangential remarks (if any) should be clearly marked as not useful, ensuring the feedback remains focused on refining the medical response effectively.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL FEEDBACK carefully.\n2. Rate INITIAL FEEDBACK on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Specificity Score after the word PREDICTION:\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 59\\nSex: F\\nDo you have pain somewhere, related to your reason for consulting?\\n    - N\\nCharacterize your pain:\\n    - burning\\n    - sharp\\nDo you feel pain somewhere?\\n    - mouth\\n    - cheek(R)\\n    - nose\\n    - eye(R)\\nHow intense is the pain?\\n    - 8 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDoes the pain radiate to another location?\\n    - back of head\\n    - nose\\n    - temple(L)\\nHow precisely is the pain located?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nHow fast did the pain appear?\\n    - 6 (possible values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\\nDo you smoke cigarettes?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a fever (either felt or measured with a thermometer)?\\n    - N\\nHave you lost your sense of smell?\\n    - N\\nHave you had a cold in the last 2 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have polyps in your nose?\\n    - N\\nDo you have asthma or have you ever had to use a bronchodilator in the past?\\n    - N\\nDo you have greenish or yellowish nasal discharge?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nAre your vaccinations up to date?\\n    - N\\nAre you more likely to develop common allergies than the general population?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Acute rhinosinusitis\\n- Chronic rhinosinusitis\\n- Acute laryngitis\\n- Chagas'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step to determine the most likely diagnosis for this patient.\n\n1. **Location of pain**: The patient reports pain in the mouth, cheek, and eye, which suggests a condition affecting the facial region.\n\n2. **Character of pain**: The pain is described as burning, which is often associated with conditions affecting the mucous membranes.\n\n3. **Intensity and duration of pain**: The pain is reported to be intense (8/10) and has appeared quickly (6/10).\n\n4. **Radiation of pain**: The pain radiates to the back of the head and temple, which is a common pattern for conditions affecting the sinuses.\n\n5. **Other symptoms**: The patient does not report fever, loss of sense of smell, nasal discharge, or polyps in the nose, which makes conditions like acute rhinosinusitis and chronic rhinosinusitis less likely.\n\n6. **Exposure history**: The patient has not traveled out of the country, has not had a cold in the last 2 weeks, and does not have a history of allergies or asthma.\n\nConsidering these factors, the most likely diagnosis is **Acute rhinosinusitis**. This condition is characterized by inflammation of the nasal passages and sinuses, often caused by a viral or bacterial infection. The patient's symptoms, such as burning pain in the facial region, intense pain, and radiation of pain to the back of the head and temple, are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\n```Acute rhinosinusitis```\n\nINITIAL FEEDBACK:\nYour reasoning for diagnosing \"Acute rhinosinusitis\" is well-structured, but there are several points that warrant further consideration:\n\n1. **Pain Characteristics**: The burning and sharp nature of the pain, along with its intensity (8/10), is notable. However, acute rhinosinusitis typically presents with more pressure-like pain rather than burning. The description of the pain may suggest a different etiology.\n\n2. **Radiation of Pain**: While the radiation of pain to the back of the head and temple can be associated with sinus issues, it is also common in other conditions, such as migraines or neuralgias. This could indicate a need to explore other headache-related conditions.\n\n3. **Absence of Key Symptoms**: The lack of fever, loss of smell, and nasal discharge significantly reduces the likelihood of acute rhinosinusitis. These symptoms are often present in cases of sinusitis, and their absence may suggest that another diagnosis should be considered.\n\n4. **Other Conditions**: \n   - **Chronic Rhinosinusitis**: Although the patient does not have a history of nasal polyps or asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis can sometimes present with facial pain without the classic symptoms of acute infection.\n   - **Acute Laryngitis**: This condition typically presents with throat pain and hoarseness, which does not align with the patient's symptoms.\n   - **Chagas Disease**: While less common, it can present with various symptoms, including facial pain, but is typically associated with travel to endemic areas or specific exposure history.\n\n5. **Consideration of Other Headache Disorders**: Given the pain's characteristics and location, it may be worthwhile to consider primary headache disorders, such as migraines or cluster headaches, which can present with similar symptoms.\n\nIn summary, while acute rhinosinusitis is a possibility, the absence of key symptoms and the nature of the pain suggest that further investigation into other potential diagnoses, including headache disorders or even neuralgias, may be warranted. \n\n```STOP```\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",
