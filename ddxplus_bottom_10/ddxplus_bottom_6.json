Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nSpecificity (1-5): How much the INITIAL FEEDBACK pinpoints exact errors, such as incorrect interpretations of medical data, misapplication of diagnostic or therapeutic protocols, vague or ambiguous statements in the response.\nA specific INITIAL FEEDBACK should suggest concrete improvements and avoid generic comments like \"improve accuracy\" without specifying how or where.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 indicates that the INITIAL FEEDBACK lacks specificity and contains significant deficiencies in addressing errors or areas for improvement. It may fail to pinpoint exact issues in the INPUT, such as inaccurate interpretations of medical data, misapplication of clinical guidelines, or vague, overly general suggestions. This level of feedback might overlook critical aspects of the INPUT, offer irrelevant comments, or provide insufficient detail to guide meaningful revisions.\nA score of 5 reflects that the INITIAL FEEDBACK is highly specific, accurate, and actionable. It clearly identifies precise errors or areas for improvement, such as misinterpretations of medical data, deviations from established protocols, or unclear statements. The feedback should be well-organized, aligned with current medical guidelines, and directly address the INPUT. Unnecessary or tangential remarks (if any) should be clearly marked as not useful, ensuring the feedback remains focused on refining the medical response effectively.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL FEEDBACK carefully.\n2. Rate INITIAL FEEDBACK on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Specificity Score after the word PREDICTION:\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 57\\nSex: F\\nHave you been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?\\n    - N\\nAre you experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing in a significant way?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel slightly dizzy or lightheaded?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known heart defect?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating very irregularly or in a disorganized pattern?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N\\nDo you have symptoms that are increased with physical exertion but alleviated with rest?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Atrial fibrillation\\n- PSVT\\n- Acute pulmonary edema\\n- Myocarditis\\n- Pulmonary embolism\\n- Panic attack\\n- Anemia\\n- Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome\\n- Scombroid food poisoning\\n- Acute dystonic reactions\\n- Myasthenia gravis\\n- Anaphylaxis\\n- SLE'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step to narrow down the possible diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and medical history.\n\n1. **Age and sex**: The patient is a 57-year-old female. This information is useful but doesn't directly point to a specific diagnosis.\n\n2. **Hyperthyroidism**: The patient denies being diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. However, it's essential to consider thyroid disorders when evaluating symptoms like palpitations or irregular heartbeat.\n\n3. **Heart valve issues and COPD**: The patient denies having severe COPD or known heart valve issues, which makes conditions like acute pulmonary edema or pulmonary embolism less likely.\n\n4. **Breathing difficulties and dizziness**: The patient denies experiencing significant shortness of breath or dizziness, which makes conditions like acute pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, or anaphylaxis less likely.\n\n5. **Heart attack, angina, and heart defects**: The patient denies having a known heart defect or experiencing heart attack or angina symptoms.\n\n6. **Irregular heartbeat**: The patient denies feeling their heart is beating irregularly or in a disorganized pattern, which makes conditions like atrial fibrillation less likely.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely options can be eliminated:\n\n- **Atrial fibrillation**: Unlikely due to the patient's denial of an irregular heartbeat.\n- **Acute pulmonary edema**: Unlikely due to the patient's denial of significant shortness of breath.\n- **Pulmonary embolism**: Unlikely due to the patient's denial of shortness of breath and dizziness.\n- **Myocarditis**: Unlikely due to the patient's denial of chest pain or irregular heartbeat.\n- **Anaphylaxis**: Unlikely due to the patient's denial of breathing difficulties and dizziness.\n- **SLE**: Unlikely due to the patient's lack of other symptoms and medical history.\n\nThe remaining options are:\n\n- **PSVT (Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia)**: A condition characterized by a rapid heartbeat that starts and stops suddenly. The patient's denial of an irregular heartbeat makes this option less likely, but it's still a possibility.\n- **Panic attack**: A condition characterized by feelings of anxiety, fear, or discomfort. The patient's denial of symptoms increased with physical exertion but alleviated with rest makes this option less likely.\n- **Anemia**: A condition characterized by a lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin. The patient's denial of symptoms like fatigue or shortness of breath makes this option less likely.\n- **Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome**: A condition characterized by muscle weakness and numbness. The patient's denial of symptoms like muscle weakness or numbness makes this option less likely.\n- **Scombroid food poisoning**: A condition characterized by symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient's denial of symptoms like nausea or vomiting makes this option less likely.\n- **Acute dystonic reactions**: A condition characterized by muscle spasms and rigidity. The patient's denial of symptoms like muscle spasms or rigidity makes this option less likely.\n- **Myasthenia gravis**: A condition characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue. The patient's denial of symptoms like muscle weakness or fatigue makes this option less likely.\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely option is:\n\n```PSVT```\n\nINITIAL FEEDBACK:\nYour reasoning process is thorough, but there are several points to consider regarding the diagnosis of PSVT (Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia):\n\n1. **Symptom Evaluation**: The patient has not reported any symptoms typically associated with PSVT, such as palpitations, dizziness, or a sensation of a racing heart. The absence of these symptoms raises questions about the likelihood of PSVT.\n\n2. **Denial of Irregular Heartbeat**: The patient explicitly denies feeling their heart beating irregularly or in a disorganized pattern, which is a significant indicator against PSVT, as patients often report a rapid heartbeat or palpitations during episodes.\n\n3. **Other Conditions**: While you have effectively ruled out many conditions based on the patient's responses, it may be worth considering that some conditions can present with subtle or atypical symptoms that the patient may not recognize or report. For example, anxiety or panic attacks can sometimes manifest without the classic symptoms.\n\n4. **Remaining Options**: Given the patient's lack of significant symptoms, it may be prudent to reconsider the remaining options. For instance, while panic attacks typically involve anxiety, they can also occur without overt physical symptoms, and the patient may not recognize them as such.\n\n5. **Anemia and Other Conditions**: Anemia could present with fatigue or weakness, which the patient may not have identified as significant. Similarly, conditions like Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome or myasthenia gravis could have subtle early symptoms that are not immediately apparent.\n\nOverall, while PSVT is a possibility, the lack of reported symptoms associated with it and the patient's clear denial of irregular heartbeat suggest that it may not be the most likely diagnosis. Further evaluation or additional information may be necessary to arrive at a more accurate diagnosis. \n\n```STOP```\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

            "\n\n<b>Evaluation Criteria: CONSISTENCY</b>\n\n PREDICTION: 4\n\nThe INITIAL FEEDBACK is generally consistent in its evaluation of the INITIAL RESPONSE. It maintains a uniform approach by systematically addressing the possibility of each condition, specifically focusing on the suggested diagnosis of PSVT. The feedback logically follows the patient's symptoms and denials, pointing out the absence of characteristic PSVT symptoms and considering alternative explanations. Additionally, feedback on other conditions remains cohesive, noting that subtle or atypical symptoms should be considered.

It critiques the reasoning behind selecting PSVT as the most likely diagnosis by pointing out the absence of key symptoms associated with PSVT, such as palpitations and irregular heartbeat, that the patient denies experiencing. It challenges the INITIAL RESPONSE's conclusion by suggesting reconsideration of other conditions, like panic attacks and anemia, which may present subtly or atypically.

The feedback also appropriately suggests reconsidering other conditions, acknowledging that some conditions may present with subtle symptoms not immediately recognizable by the patient. However, it would be helpful if the feedback further explored other possible explanations based on the symptoms presented or provided specific guidance on how to further evaluate or seek additional information. Such improvements would have warranted a perfect score. Nonetheless, the feedback is precise, well-reasoned, and helpful in refining the INITIAL RESPONSE.",

It emphasizes the absence of PSVT-associated symptoms such as palpitations or dizziness, as well as the patient's explicit denial of an irregular heartbeat, which significantly contends the likelihood of PSVT.\n\nThe feedback also offers suggestions on remaining diagnostic options, pointing out that certain conditions, such as panic attacks or anxiety, might present atypically or be unrecognized by the patient. This insight helps the model consider alternative possibilities beyond the obvious symptoms.\n\nFinally, the feedback suggests considering subtle presentations of conditions like anemia, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, or myasthenia gravis, even if they haven't been currently noted by the patient. This encourages the model to approach diagnosis with the understanding that initial symptoms might be underreported or atypical, leading to a more nuanced consideration.\n\nOverall, the feedback avoids undue criticism and instead encourages refinement with logical reasoning and actionable suggestions. The only small area for improvement might be providing even more actionable next steps, which prevents it from getting a perfect score."
