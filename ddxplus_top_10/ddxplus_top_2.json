Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\n[Criterion]\nSpecificity (1-5): How much the INITIAL FEEDBACK pinpoints exact errors, such as incorrect interpretations of medical data, misapplication of diagnostic or therapeutic protocols, vague or ambiguous statements in the response.\nA specific INITIAL FEEDBACK should suggest concrete improvements and avoid generic comments like \"improve accuracy\" without specifying how or where.\n\nFor your information:\nA score of 1 indicates that the INITIAL FEEDBACK lacks specificity and contains significant deficiencies in addressing errors or areas for improvement. It may fail to pinpoint exact issues in the INPUT, such as inaccurate interpretations of medical data, misapplication of clinical guidelines, or vague, overly general suggestions. This level of feedback might overlook critical aspects of the INPUT, offer irrelevant comments, or provide insufficient detail to guide meaningful revisions.\nA score of 5 reflects that the INITIAL FEEDBACK is highly specific, accurate, and actionable. It clearly identifies precise errors or areas for improvement, such as misinterpretations of medical data, deviations from established protocols, or unclear statements. The feedback should be well-organized, aligned with current medical guidelines, and directly address the INPUT. Unnecessary or tangential remarks (if any) should be clearly marked as not useful, ensuring the feedback remains focused on refining the medical response effectively.\n\n[Evaluation Steps]\n1. Read INPUT and INITIAL FEEDBACK carefully.\n2. Rate INITIAL FEEDBACK on a scale of 1-5 according to the criterion above.\n3. Provide a brief explanation for your rating.\n4. ALWAYS provide the Specificity Score after the word PREDICTION:\n\n[Your Task]\nINPUT:\n{'evidences': 'Age: 51\\nSex: M\\nDo you have a known issue with one of your heart valves?\\n    - N\\nDo you have high blood pressure or do you take medications to treat high blood pressure?\\n    - N\\nHave you ever had a heart attack or do you have angina (chest pain)?\\n    - N\\nDo you have a known heart defect?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating fast (racing), irregularly (missing a beat) or do you feel palpitations?\\n    - N\\nDo you feel your heart is beating very irregularly or in a disorganized pattern?\\n    - N\\nHave you traveled out of the country in the last 4 weeks?\\n    - N', 'options': '- Atrial fibrillation'}\n\nINITIAL RESPONSE:\nLet's think step by step to determine the most likely diagnosis for this patient.\n\n1. The patient is a 51-year-old male with no known heart issues, high blood pressure, heart attack, angina, or heart defects.\n2. He does not experience palpitations, irregular heartbeat, or a disorganized heart rhythm.\n3. The patient's symptoms and medical history do not suggest any immediate cardiovascular concerns.\n\nConsidering the patient's age and the absence of any symptoms or risk factors for cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation (AFib) is less likely. AFib is a common arrhythmia that can occur in older adults, often with underlying heart disease or other risk factors.\n\nHowever, given the options provided, we must choose the most likely diagnosis based on the information available.\n\n```Atrial fibrillation```\n\nINITIAL FEEDBACK:\nYour reasoning regarding the patient's symptoms and medical history is sound, but there are some important considerations to address:\n\n1. **Absence of Symptoms**: The patient explicitly denies experiencing palpitations, irregular heartbeat, or any disorganized heart rhythm. This significantly reduces the likelihood of atrial fibrillation, as it typically presents with these symptoms.\n\n2. **Risk Factors**: The patient has no known risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as high blood pressure, previous heart attacks, or heart defects. Atrial fibrillation is often associated with these conditions, making it less likely in this case.\n\n3. **Age Consideration**: While age can be a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, the absence of other contributing factors or symptoms is crucial. Many individuals in this age group do not develop AFib without underlying heart issues.\n\n4. **Other Diagnoses**: Given the lack of symptoms and risk factors, it may be beneficial to consider other potential diagnoses or conditions that could explain any subtle symptoms the patient may not have reported.\n\nOverall, while you concluded that atrial fibrillation is the most likely diagnosis based on the options provided, the absence of relevant symptoms and risk factors suggests that this diagnosis may not be appropriate. It would be prudent to reassess the options or consider that the patient may not have a cardiovascular issue at all. \n\nIn this case, it might be more accurate to state that atrial fibrillation is unlikely rather than concluding it as the diagnosis. \n\n```STOP```\n\n[OUTPUT]\nPREDICTION:\n",

            "\n\n<b>Evaluation Criteria: CONSISTENCY</b>\n\n PREDICTION: 5\n\nThe INITIAL FEEDBACK is consistent throughout and aligns well with the medical reasoning presented in the INITIAL RESPONSE. It reiterates the absence of symptoms typically associated with atrial fibrillation, such as palpitations and irregular heartbeats, emphasizing why AFib is unlikely. The feedback consistently points out the lack of risk factors and underscores the significance of these factors, maintaining a uniform tone when addressing the diagnosis. It does not contradict itself and provides logical, coherent suggestions, such as considering other diagnoses or acknowledging that the patient may not have a cardiovascular issue at all.

The feedback explains the significance of the absence of symptoms and risk factors, emphasizing the critical aspects of the patient's profile that reduce the likelihood of AFib. It also considers the importance of age as a contributing factor while acknowledging it is not the sole determinant. Lastly, it suggests the possibility of considering other diagnoses and questioning the assumption that a cardiovascular issue is present. This comprehensive approach to feedback aligns with medical guidelines and enhances clinical reasoning and clarity.",
            "\n\n<b>Evaluation Criteria: CORRECTNESS</b>\n\n PREDICTION: 5\n\nThe INITIAL FEEDBACK aligns well with established medical knowledge and provides a detailed and logical analysis of why atrial fibrillation (AFib) is unlikely given the patient's lack of symptoms and risk factors. The feedback accurately points out that the patient denies experiencing key symptoms associated with AFib, such as palpitations and irregular heartbeat, and highlights the absence of risk factors like high blood pressure or heart defects. Additionally, it correctly notes that age alone, without other contributing factors or symptoms, does not strongly indicate AFib. The INITIAL FEEDBACK suggests reconsidering other potential diagnoses, which is a reasonable suggestion considering the input data. Overall, the feedback is precise, adheres to current medical understanding, and effectively challenges the conclusion drawn in the INITIAL RESPONSE, justifying a score of 5 for correctness.",
            "\n\n<b>Evaluation Criteria: CONSTRUCTIVENESS</b>\n\n PREDICTION: 5\n\nThe INITIAL FEEDBACK is highly constructive as it thoroughly evaluates the INITIAL RESPONSE in terms of the patient's symptoms, medical history, and risk factors for atrial fibrillation. The feedback points out the lack of symptoms such as palpitations or irregular heartbeat, which are typically present in atrial fibrillation cases. It also considers the patient's age and the absence of other risk factors, guiding the reader to understand why atrial fibrillation may not be the appropriate diagnosis here. Furthermore, it suggests exploring alternative diagnoses, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the medical context. The feedback is clear and offers actionable guidance for reassessment, resulting in a well-supported critique that encourages improvement without being overly critical."
